# Marcodagrada
I was just wandering if I could build my online portfolio using the amazing <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vuepress</a>.

So I tried it. It's amazing!

If you want to try to play with the project itself you can simply:

``` bash
# clone or fork the repo
git clone git@github.com:tr4uma/marcodagrada.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# start playing around (this will start a server on port 8080 with hot reload)
npm run docs:dev

# quick and easy docs!
```
